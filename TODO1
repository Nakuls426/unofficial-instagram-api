make a array with name 'edges'
and stores json array object in it.

to get all video urls and shortcodes 
i have to return array and shortcode function together.

**This is how my API will looks like.** 
info : [
    
    {
      shortcode : "",
      video_url :  "",  
      thumbnail_pic :  ""
    },
    {
      shortcode : "",
      video_url :  "",  
      thumbnail_pic :  ""
    },
    {
      shortcode : "",
      video_url :  "",  
      thumbnail_pic :  ""
    },

]

what to do if the user upload slide with 1 video and 1 image.
i want to store video into a json name called info object not in array.
check weather the video is two or more if it is more than one put it in json array obviously.
check weather the video is only one and rest is images.
I'm making my own API from Instagram's public API. So basically what my api will do is it will show user all the slide-videos and the user can decide which one to download. In my API i just want all videos url and shortcode.

** Currently API supports **
HD pics
get all slide videos.
mixed up of videos and images in a slide.
get only one video.
Reel video
IG TV
